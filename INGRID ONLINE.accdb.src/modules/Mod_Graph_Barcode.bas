' Description: the indention of this library is a short and compact implementation to create barcodes
'  of Code 128, Data Matrix, (micro) QR or Aztec symbols so it could be easily adapted for individual requirements.
'  Each TextBox in reports containing 'Aztec','Code128', 'DataMatrix' or 'QRCode' in the name
'  is replaced by the corresponding barcode image.
'  Individual settings are possible but require adjustments in the Sub Detail_Format().
'  The smallest bar code symbol fitting the data is automatically selected,
'  but no size optimization for mixed data types in one code is done.
' Functions:
'   drawAztec(text as TextBox, Optional security as integer, Optional layers as integer)
'   drawCode128(text As TextBox)
'   drawDataMatrix(text As TextBox)
'   drawQuickResponse(text As TextBox, Optional level As String, Optional version As Integer = 1)
'
